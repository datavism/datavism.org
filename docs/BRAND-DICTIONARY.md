## üé® **VISUAL IDENTITY IDEAS**

### **Logo Style:**
- Corrupted/glitched versions of real logos
- Dark, dystopian aesthetic
- Surveillance and manipulation motifs
- Green/yellow/red (DATAVISM colors)

### **Marketing Copy:**
```
"MetaFace knows you better than you know yourself.
That's not a feature. That's a warning."

"InstaPic: Where your insecurities become our revenue."

"Chirpstream: Because calm discourse doesn't monetize."
```

---

## üìù **EXAMPLES IN CONTEXT**

### **Challenge Narrative:**
```
MAYA: "I worked at MetaFace for three years.
Built the emotional targeting algorithm.
When users were sad, we showed them comfort purchases.
When angry, political ads.
When lonely, social validation content.

InstaPic, Chirpstream, TokTik - they all do it.
But MetaFace perfected it."
```

### **Code Example:**
```python
# Load your MetaFace data export
df = pd.read_csv("metaface_data.csv")

# Analyze manipulation patterns
manipulation = df[df['platform'] == 'MetaFace']
print(f"Times MetaFace targeted you when vulnerable: {len(manipulation)}")

# Compare across platforms
platforms = ['MetaFace', 'InstaPic', 'Chirpstream']
for platform in platforms:
    revenue = df[df['platform'] == platform]['ad_revenue'].sum()
    print(f"{platform} extracted: ${revenue:.2f}")
```

### **Boss Battle:**
```
BOSS: THE METAFACE ALGORITHM OVERLORD

"You think you understand me?
I am 847 million lines of code.
I know your fears, your desires, your weaknesses.
I was trained on 2.4 billion humans.
What are you?"

MAYA: "Someone who knows your source code.
Someone who can teach others to read it.
Someone who's not afraid anymore."
```

## üëª **GHOST'S NOTES**

These fake brands serve three purposes:

1. **Legal:** Can't sue us for using "MetaFace" to teach about manipulation
2. **Satirical:** More impactful when obviously mocking
3. **Educational:** Clearer examples when we control the narrative

**Remember:** Everyone knows who we're talking about. That's the point.
