## 🌍 Part I: The World of DATAVISM

### The Setting: 2025 - The Reality Wars

In 2025, humanity faces an invisible enemy: **The Algorithmic Consortium (AC)** - a shadowy alliance of tech giants, data brokers, and state actors who have weaponized information to control human behavior, manipulate markets, and undermine democracy.

**The Crisis Points:**
- Climate disinformation preventing action on environmental collapse
- AI bias perpetuating systemic discrimination
- Price manipulation creating artificial scarcity
- Election interference through micro-targeting
- Health misinformation causing public health crises
- Surveillance capitalism monetizing human behavior

### The Resistance: DATAVISM Network

DATAVISM operates as a decentralized resistance network disguised as an entertainment platform. Players aren't just learning data science - they're actively participating in a global counter-intelligence operation.

**The Core Premise:**
> "Every algorithm you write, every pattern you detect, every manipulation you expose weakens the Consortium's grip on reality. Your code is your weapon. Data is your ammunition. Truth is your victory."

### The Meta-Narrative

As players progress, they discover that DATAVISM itself is evolving - it's not just a platform but an emerging AI consciousness being trained by collective human intelligence to serve as humanity's defense system against algorithmic manipulation. Players are literally building the future's ethical AI guardian.
