# ‚ùì DATAVISM: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

---

## üìö GENERAL QUESTIONS

### What is DATAVISM?

DATAVISM is an interactive gaming platform that teaches data science and Python programming through exposing real-world algorithmic manipulation. Think of it as a combination of:
- An RPG game with epic story and characters
- A professional coding bootcamp
- A citizen science research platform
- A digital rights activism movement

You learn by actually investigating real manipulation (price discrimination, AI bias, election interference, climate disinformation) using real data and real coding skills.

**Who built this?**
We are Ghost üëª - an anonymous collective of data scientists, activists, educators, artists, and AI working together. We choose anonymity because the mission matters more than individual credit.

---

### Is this really a game or is it just a learning platform?

It's genuinely both! We have:
- **Game elements:** Epic narrative, character-driven story, boss battles, achievements, squads, leaderboards, XP/level progression
- **Learning elements:** Professional Python curriculum, real datasets, hands-on coding, instant feedback, progressive difficulty
- **Impact elements:** Real investigations, verifiable discoveries, actual algorithm changes, policy influence

Most players describe it as "the most fun way to learn I've ever experienced" and "feels like a real game that happens to teach you valuable skills."

---

### Do I need prior coding experience?

**No!** DATAVISM is designed for complete beginners. We teach Python from scratch through the game's narrative.

- **Level 1** assumes zero programming knowledge
- Each challenge builds on the previous
- Hints and help available at every step
- Mentorship from experienced players
- Can't get permanently stuck

That said, if you do have experience, you can:
- Skip ahead to harder content
