## 💡 KEY DECISIONS & INSIGHTS

### **Critical Decision: NO Traditional Videos**

**Context:**
User provided Maya Chen video scripts (hour1-video-scripts.md) with full InVideo AI production guide.

**Decision:**
- ❌ NOT doing passive video lectures (Coursera/Udemy style)
- ✅ YES doing interactive animated text sequences (Visual Novel style)
- ✅ Optional voice synthesis for Maya (Web Speech API)
- ✅ Story beats from scripts but delivery changes

**Rationale:**
"I don't want video + text + multiple choice structure. I want interactive edutainment with all features modern web dev offers. Interaction, entertainment, immersion + real data connection."

### **Product Philosophy**

**DATAVISM is:**
- ✅ AAA game that teaches
- ✅ Immersive web experience
- ✅ Every second interactive
- ✅ Real data, real problems
- ✅ Next-level edutainment

**DATAVISM is NOT:**
- ❌ Coursera (video → quiz → certificate)
- ❌ Codecademy (text → fill blanks → multiple choice)
- ❌ Khan Academy (lecture → practice problems)

**Success Metric:**
Players should think "I just helped Maya expose MetaFace" not "I completed a course"

### **Fake Brands Strategy**

**Why:**
1. Legal protection (can't sue for parody)
2. Satirical impact (more memorable)
3. Educational clarity (we control narrative)

**How:**
- Always use fake brands (MetaFace not Facebook)
- Obvious who we're parodying
- Keep it funny and sharp
- Document everything

**Examples:**
- MetaFace Corp. → "Connecting Minds. Extracting Data."
- Chirpstream → "Speak Your Mind. We'll Weaponize It."
- Amazin Corp. → "Everything You Want. Everything We Know."

/>
```

**Priority B: Sound Design**
```typescript
// Add audio feedback
import { Howl } from 'howler'

const playTypingSound = new Howl({ src: ['/sounds/typing.mp3'] })

```

**Priority C: Live Data Visualization**

}
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS

### **DO:**

- ✅ Ghost branding everywhere

### **DON'T:**

- ❌ Forget the entertainment aspect
- ❌ Lose sight of social impact mission

### **REMEMBER:**
- Users are "players" not "students"
- Challenges are "missions" not "exercises"
- Maya is "whistleblower guide" not "instructor"
- We're building a "game" not a "course"
- Success = "I helped expose MetaFace" not "I got a certificate"

## 🚨 BLOCKERS & RISKS

### **Current Blockers:**
- None! All systems go ✅

### **Potential Risks:**
1. **Scope creep** - Too many features, not enough focus
   - Mitigation: Focus on Level 1 perfection first

2. **Technical complexity** - 3D viz, real-time, etc. might be hard
   - Mitigation: Prototype before committing

3. **Content creation** - 50+ hours needs writing
   - Mitigation: User stories already created, just implement

4. **Legal** - Despite fake brands, still some risk
   - Mitigation: Obvious satire/parody, educational use

## 💭 PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES

### **Why DATAVISM Matters:**

From INTERACTIVE-EDUTAINMENT-VISION.md:
> "DATAVISM is not a course. It's an experience. When someone finishes Level 1, they shouldn't think 'I completed a course' - they should think 'I just helped Maya expose MetaFace and learned Python by fighting an algorithm.'"

### **The Ghost Principle:**

From TEAM-STRUCTURE.md:
> "We choose anonymity because the mission matters more than individual credit. Decentralized leadership is more resilient. Our users are the heroes, not us."

### **The Edutainment Standard:**

From INTERACTIVE-EDUTAINMENT-VISION.md:
> "It should feel like playing Portal 2, not doing homework. Every second is active, never passive. Real data, real stakes, real impact."

## 👻 GHOST'S NOTES TO SELF

**Things I learned this session:**
- User is VERY clear about no traditional course structure
- Videos are great for story but not for lectures
- Fake brands are perfect - legal + satirical + fun
- Interactive > passive always
- Real data connection is non-negotiable
- Speed matters - user wants to move fast

**Things to remember:**
- Always check INTERACTIVE-EDUTAINMENT-VISION.md before building
- MetaFace not Facebook, always
- Ghost branding in everything
- Make it fun first, educational second (they're equal!)
- Real-time features are differentiator

**Things to avoid:**
- Don't suggest video lectures
