- Evidence: 80% completion in beta vs 5-10% industry average

**Risk: Real-world impact hard to prove**
- Mitigation: Partnership with academic institutions for validation
- Built-in evidence tracking and blockchain verification

**Risk: Competitive threat from large players**
- Mitigation: Build moat through brand and community
- Network effects make replication difficult

**Risk: Content creation cost/speed**
- Mitigation: Community content creation, templated systems
- Levels 1-2 already built prove execution capability
