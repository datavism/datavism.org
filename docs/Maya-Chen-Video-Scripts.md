[SCENE 1: USER POV - SCROLLING SOCIAL MEDIA]
Visual: Smartphone screen showing endless feed scrolling
Sound: Satisfying scroll sounds, notifications pinging

MAYA (VOICEOVER):
Right now, as you scroll, forty-seven algorithms are analyzing you. 
Your pause time. Your scroll speed. Even the pressure of your thumb on the screen.

[VISUAL EFFECT: Feed begins to glitch, showing hidden data layers]
Digital overlay text appears: "engagement_rate: 0.84", "dopamine_trigger: activated", "ad_revenue: $2.34"

MAYA (V.O.):
They know you'll scroll past this. They know exactly what would make you stop.
Fear? Anger? Desire? They have the formula.

[SCENE 2: MAYA APPEARS - DARK ROOM WITH SCREENS]
Visual: Maya in black hoodie, face half-lit by green computer glow
Multiple screens behind her showing code, graphs, manipulation data

MAYA (ON CAMERA):
My name is Maya Chen. For three years, I was a Senior Data Scientist at Facebook.
[Shows Facebook employee badge on screen]
My job? Make you scroll. Make you click. Make you buy.

[VISUAL: Code snippets of actual engagement algorithms]

MAYA:
I wrote algorithms that predicted your next emotion before you felt it.
This function here? It knows you're vulnerable at 11:47 PM.
This one? It serves you ads when you're sad.

[VISUAL: Maya's hands typing, deleting Facebook code]

MAYA:
I thought we were connecting people. We were creating addicts.
[Emotional pause]
That night, I copied everything. Three terabytes of evidence.
Then I ran.

[SCENE 3: THE INVITATION]
Visual: Matrix-style digital rain effect
Text overlay: "WAKE UP. THEY'RE HARVESTING YOUR MIND."

MAYA:
If you're watching this, you're ready for the red pill.
Not the philosophy. The code.
Today, you learn Python. Not to build websites.
To break digital chains.

[VISUAL: Python logo transforms into key, unlocking digital locks]

MAYA:
Welcome to the resistance. Your awakening begins now.

[END SCREEN: "BEGIN YOUR DIGITAL LIBERATION"]

MAYA:
December 15th, 2022. I ran my own algorithm on myself.
[Screen shows Maya's personal data analysis]
Manipulation score: 8.7 out of 10.
73% of my decisions were algorithmically influenced.

[Emotional pause, Maya looks down, then back up with determination]

MAYA:
My coffee brand. My workout time. My political views.
Even my relationship status - all optimized for engagement.
I wasn't using Facebook. Facebook was using me.

[SCENE 4: THE MISSION]
Visual: Maya standing, screens showing resistance network behind her

MAYA:
I can't fight them alone. But I can teach you their language.
Python. The same tools they use to manipulate.
We'll use to liberate.

Look at this social media feed. Looks random, right?
[Python script runs, reveals hidden patterns]
Forty-seven pieces of content in thirty seconds. All calculated.

[VISUAL: Data visualization showing manipulation timeline]

MAYA:
Every like triggers a function. Every scroll, an algorithm.
Every pause longer than 1.3 seconds? They know you're interested.

[SCENE 2: WEAPONS LOADING SEQUENCE]
Visual: Dramatic loading animation for Python libraries

MAYA:
We're not installing software. We're installing consciousness.

df.groupby('emotional_state')['ads_shown'].sum()
[Results show: vulnerable: 847 ads, sad: 423 ads]

MAYA:
Eight hundred forty-seven ads served when this person was vulnerable.
That's not marketing. That's predatory behavior.

[SCENE 4: THE COUNTER-ALGORITHM]
Visual: Maya writing code that fights back

MAYA:
But here's the secret they don't want you to know.
[Types defensive code]

def detect_manipulation(content):

def keep_user_scrolling(user_data):
    if user_data.emotional_state == 'sad':
        show_comfort_purchases()
    elif user_data.time_of_day > 23:
        show_social_validation_content()
    elif user_data.scroll_speed > 10:
        inject_controversy()
    return user_still_scrolling

[Visual effects highlight each condition]

MAYA:
Sad users get shopping ads. Late night users get validation.
Fast scrollers get controversy. It's behavioral manipulation at industrial scale.

[SCENE 3: BUILDING YOUR COUNTER-WEAPON]
Visual: Maya codes defensively, each line appears with weight

MAYA:
Your function. Your rules. Your freedom.
[Types with intention]

def detect_manipulation(post_text, post_timing, user_state):
    manipulation_score = 0
    
    # Check for trigger words
    triggers = ['BREAKING', 'URGENT', 'Last chance', 'You won\'t believe']
    for trigger in triggers:
        if trigger in post_text:
            manipulation_score += 25
    
    # Check for vulnerability timing
    if post_timing.hour > 22 and user_state == 'tired':
        manipulation_score += 30
    
    # Check for emotional exploitation
    if user_state in ['sad', 'angry', 'lonely'] and 'buy' in post_text:
        manipulation_score += 40
    
    if manipulation_score > 50:

What I'm about to show you is classified.
[Dramatic pause, types with authority]
My own Facebook data export. Three years of my digital life.
Every click. Every pause. Every moment of weakness.

[Visual: File loading with progress bar, tension building]

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("maya_facebook_data.csv")

[Data loads, Maya's expression changes to shock]

MAYA:
Jesus. I forgot how much they track.

[SCENE 2: THE DIGITAL ANATOMY]
Visual: Maya explores her own data, genuine emotional reactions

MAYA:
Look at this DataFrame. Each row is a moment they captured me.
[Points to specific rows]
df.head()

[Data table appears showing]:
timestamp, emotional_state, content_type, engagement_time, ad_revenue, manipulation_score

MAYA:
October 15th, 2:34 AM. Emotional state: vulnerable.
Content served: targeted breakup recovery ads.
Revenue generated from my pain: $4.73.

[Emotional pause, Maya looks directly at camera]

MAYA:
Four dollars and seventy-three cents. That's what my heartbreak was worth to them.

[SCENE 3: DEEPER INTO THE MATRIX]
Visual: Maya digs deeper, DataFrames flowing like Matrix code

MAYA:
But Pandas shows us everything. Their entire business model.
[Types analysis commands]

# How much money did they make from my emotions?
emotional_profit = df.groupby('emotional_state')['ad_revenue'].sum()
print(emotional_profit)

[Results appear]:
sad: $847.23
vulnerable: $1,203.45
angry: $634.87
happy: $234.12

Visual: Data visualizations revealing manipulation patterns

MAYA:
Let's see when they hit me hardest.
[Creates time-based analysis]

hourly_manipulation = df.groupby('hour')['manipulation_score'].mean()
hourly_manipulation.plot()

[Graph shows peak manipulation at late night hours]

MAYA:
3 AM. Every night, like clockwork.
When I was tired, lonely, making bad decisions.
That's when their algorithms struck.

[Zooms into specific data points]

MAYA:
Look at this pattern. Every breakup, every job rejection, every family fight.
They detected my emotional state and monetized it within minutes.

[SCENE 5: THE LIBERATION PROTOCOL]
Visual: Maya writing code to free others

MAYA:
But here's the beautiful thing about Pandas.
What they use to trap us, we can use to free us.

[Types new analysis code]

def analyze_personal_exploitation(dataframe):
    exploitation_report = {
        'total_revenue_generated': dataframe['ad_revenue'].sum(),
        'emotional_targeting_events': len(dataframe[dataframe['emotional_state'] != 'neutral']),
        'late_night_targeting': len(dataframe[dataframe['hour'] > 22]),
        'vulnerability_exploitation': dataframe[dataframe['emotional_state'] == 'vulnerable']['ad_revenue'].sum()
    }
    return exploitation_report

[Function runs, shows shocking results]

MAYA:
Every person who runs this analysis sees their digital exploitation.
Every DataFrame we create is a step toward freedom.

Pandas isn't just data analysis. It's data liberation.
Your data. Your analysis. Your truth.

## ðŸ“¹ VIDEO 6: "Data Selection - Finding Their Secrets"
**Duration:** 4 minutes  
**Timing:** Challenge 6 - Vulnerability Analysis  
**Mood:** Detective thriller, uncovering hidden patterns

### Full Production Script

```
[SCENE 1: THE INVESTIGATION BEGINS]
Visual: Maya as detective, data displayed like evidence board

MAYA:
Data filtering is detective work. You're looking for patterns they hoped you'd never see.
[Adjusts detective lamp, focuses on screen]

Let's find when they manipulate you most.

[Types filtering commands with precision]

# Find vulnerable moments
vulnerable_posts = df[df['emotional_state'] == 'vulnerable']
print(f"Vulnerable targeting events: {len(vulnerable_posts)}")

[Results shock even Maya]

MAYA:
847 times. They targeted me when I was vulnerable 847 times in one year.
That's more than twice a day.

[SCENE 2: TIME-BASED TARGETING]
Visual: Clock spinning, highlighting manipulation timing

MAYA:
But when exactly do they strike?
[Types time analysis]

# Late night vulnerability exploitation
night_posts = df[df['hour'] >= 22]
night_vulnerability = night_posts[night_posts['emotional_state'] == 'vulnerable']

print(f"Late night vulnerability targeting: {len(night_vulnerability)}")
print(f"Average revenue per late night vulnerable post: ${night_posts['ad_revenue'].mean():.2f}")

[Results appear with dramatic emphasis]

MAYA:
They make 340% more money from you after 10 PM.
When you're tired. When your defenses are down.
When you make emotional decisions.

[SCENE 3: EMOTIONAL PROFIT MATRIX]
Visual: Heat map visualization of emotional exploitation

MAYA:
Let's see the full picture of emotional exploitation.
[Creates comprehensive analysis]

# Emotional state profit analysis
emotion_analysis = df.groupby(['emotional_state', 'content_type']).agg({
    'ad_revenue': 'sum',
    'engagement_time': 'mean',
    'manipulation_score': 'mean'
}).round(2)

print(emotion_analysis)

[Table reveals shocking patterns]

MAYA:
Look at this. Sad + Shopping Content = $3.47 average revenue.
Happy + Shopping Content = $0.89 average revenue.
They literally profit from human misery.

[SCENE 4: THE TARGETING ALGORITHM]
Visual: Maya reveals the targeting decision tree

MAYA:
Here's their targeting algorithm, reverse-engineered from the data:
[Draws flowchart while explaining]

If user.emotional_state == 'sad':
    show_content_type = 'comfort_purchase'
    multiply_ad_frequency = 2.3

If user.time == 'late_night' AND user.emotional_state == 'vulnerable':
    show_content_type = 'social_validation'
    multiply_ad_frequency = 3.7

If user.scroll_speed > 'average' AND user.engagement_time < 30:
    show_content_type = 'controversy'
    
[Visual: Decision tree branches leading to profit outcomes]

MAYA:
Every IF statement is a manipulation tactic.
Every THEN clause is money extracted from human weakness.

[SCENE 5: THE COUNTERSTRIKE]
Visual: Maya writing detection code

MAYA:
But now you know their patterns. Time to build your immunity.
[Types defensive filtering code]

def detect_targeted_manipulation(dataframe):
    red_flags = []
    
    # Check for emotional state targeting
    emotional_targeting = dataframe[dataframe['emotional_state'] != 'neutral']
    if len(emotional_targeting) / len(dataframe) > 0.4:
        red_flags.append("High emotional state targeting detected")
    
    # Check for late night exploitation
    night_targeting = dataframe[dataframe['hour'] > 22]
    if night_targeting['ad_revenue'].mean() > dataframe['ad_revenue'].mean() * 1.5:
        red_flags.append("Late night financial exploitation detected")
    
    # Check for vulnerability exploitation
    vuln_targeting = dataframe[dataframe['emotional_state'] == 'vulnerable']
    if len(vuln_targeting) > 100:  # More than 100 vulnerable targeting events
        red_flags.append("Systematic vulnerability exploitation detected")
    
    return red_flags

warnings = detect_targeted_manipulation(df)
for warning in warnings:
    print(f"ðŸš¨ {warning}")

[Multiple warnings appear]

MAYA:
Every filter you write is a shield against manipulation.
Every pattern you recognize is power returned to you.
You're not just analyzing data. You're analyzing your freedom.

[END SCREEN: "PATTERNS REVEALED. IMMUNITY ACTIVATED."]
