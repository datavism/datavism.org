# DATAVISM: ONE-PAGE OVERVIEW

---

## 🎯 THE VISION

**DATAVISM gamifies data activism, teaching data science through exposing real algorithmic manipulation.**

We combine AAA gaming, professional education, and measurable social impact into the world's first "reality defense network" where every player becomes a digital rights activist.

## 💡 THE PROBLEM

| Market | Problem | Impact |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **EdTech ($87B)** | 5-10% completion rates, boring content | $70B wasted on failed learning |
| **Gaming ($200B)** | Engaging but purposeless | 3B gamers developing no transferable skills |
| **Society** | Algorithmic manipulation everywhere | $500B+ annual losses, democracy threatened |

**The Gap:** No platform makes learning data science engaging while creating real-world impact.

---

## ✨ THE SOLUTION

**A narrative-driven game where players:**
1. Learn Python & data science through 50+ hours of content
2. Expose real manipulation (pricing, AI bias, climate lies, elections)
3. Form squads for collaborative investigations
4. Create measurable change (algorithms changed, policies influenced)

**Key Innovation:** Real code + real data + real impact = unprecedented engagement
